# To recursively search the current directory, while respecting all .gitignore files, ignore hidden files and directories and skip binary files:
# The command also respects all .ignore files, including in parent directories. .ignore files can be used when .gitignore files are insufficient. In all cases, .ignore patterns take precedence over .gitignore.
rg foobar

# To ignore all ignore files, use -u. To additionally search hidden files and directories, use -uu. To additionally search binary files, use -uuu. (In other words, "search everything, dammit!") In particular, rg -uuu is similar to grep -a -r.
rg -uu foobar  # similar to `grep -r`
rg -uuu foobar  # similar to `grep -a -r`

# (Tip: If your ignore files aren't being adhered to like you expect, run your search with the --debug flag.)
# Make the search case insensitive with -i, invert the search with -v or show the 2 lines before and after every search result with -C2.
# Force all matches to be surrounded by word boundaries with -w.

# Search and replace (find first and last names and swap them):
rg '([A-Z][a-z]+)\s+([A-Z][a-z]+)' --replace '$2, $1'

# Named groups are supported:
rg '(?P<first>[A-Z][a-z]+)\s+(?P<last>[A-Z][a-z]+)' --replace '$last, $first'

# Up the ante with full Unicode support, by matching any uppercase Unicode letter followed by any sequence of lowercase Unicode letters (good luck doing this with other search tools!):
rg '(\p{Lu}\p{Ll}+)\s+(\p{Lu}\p{Ll}+)' --replace '$2, $1'

# Search only files matching a particular glob:
rg foo -g 'README.*'

# Or exclude files matching a particular glob:
rg foo -g '!*.min.js'

# Search and return paths matching a particular glob (i.e., -g flag in ag/ack):
rg -g 'doc*' --files

# Search only HTML and CSS files:
rg -thtml -tcss foobar

# Search everything except for Javascript files:
rg -Tjs foobar

# To see a list of types supported, run rg --type-list. To add a new type, use --type-add, which must be accompanied by a pattern for searching (rg won't persist your type settings):
rg --type-add 'foo:*.{foo,foobar}' -tfoo bar
